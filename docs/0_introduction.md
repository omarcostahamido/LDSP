# LDSP

A C++ software environment to hack your Android phone and program it as a low-level embedded audio board.

## BEFORE YOU START!
Your Android Phone needs to be rooted. This process highly depends on the specific brand and model of your phone, and may take from 5 minutes to several days. The XDA forum is the best place to look for guides/how-tos and get help:
[https://forum.xda-developers.com/](https://forum.xda-developers.com/)

Then, make sure that you have Developer Options enabled on the phone, then inside Developer options activate USB debugging.
