## How to build and use example LDSP applications on your phone

LDSP comes with a variety of example projects and libraries that can be used out of the box. Let's see how to build and play around with the #sine# example that you can find  [LDSP/examples/sine](../examples/sine). Note that all LDSP projects (including examples) consist of a dedicated folder with inside at least a source file called 'render.cpp' (more on this in the [next section](#how-to-design-your-own-ldsp-application)).


LIST ALL STEPS BEFOREHAND (congigure, build, install, run, stop, run_persistent) and then explain with numbered list... 

Open a shell on your laptop (i.e., a 'local' shell) and navigate to the LDSP folder, where you downladed the content of the repo.
