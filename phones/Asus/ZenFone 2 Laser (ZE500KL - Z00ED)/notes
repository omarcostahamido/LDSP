Handset mic is the same as regular mic

Torch and lcd backlight seem unresponsive, probably Android is not using the usual system drivers

The phone has 2 LEDs, red and green, but they cannot be controlled truly independently, i.e., when both are on, each new brightness value is applied to both; but if only one is on, then the led controls as expected.
This behavior is equivalent to have 3 LEDS, red, green and orange, that cannot be combined
