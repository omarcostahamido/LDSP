This is an uncommon phone

The ldsp_architecture.sh script is not able to detect the type of architecture, 
because this info is not included in '/proc/cpuinfo'
by running 'cat /proc/cpuinfo' it is possible to see that it comes with neon
and the architecture can be found on the internet [32 bits -> armv7a]

The mixer routing requires an extra command to switch to line-out/line-in that is currently not support by LDSP, so for now only speaker/mic and handset work

Only multitouch has been tested so far
