all mixer paths are placeholders:
line-out/in are not needed, as line-out/in is accessible via USB as card 1 [when adapter is connected]
mic should likely be asr-mic [more testing needed]
speaker path should change nothing, for the default settings activate the speaker path already! indeed current speaker path was chosen because empty ['speaker' path in xml file is WRONG]

phone's codec has an annoying compander [compressor+expander] that cannot seem to be turned off

cannot control flashlight
